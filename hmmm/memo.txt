Question 1: This program takes the numbers until the last one is 0 and 
prints their average and remainder. If first number is 0, it doesn't print anything. 
Here, what I have done is add all the input numbers except 0, which is considered the
last input and then found the average and remaider by using a counter to find the total
number of input.
>>> 
Enter debugging mode? no
Enter number: 0
>>> 
Enter debugging mode? no
Enter number: 1
Enter number: 2
Enter number: 3
Enter number: 0
2
0
>>> 
Enter debugging mode? no
Enter number: 100
Enter number: 101
Enter number: 102
Enter number: 103
Enter number: 0
101
2


Question 2: This program will find the Nth term from Fiboanacci series (1,1,2,3,5...)
and if N is 0 or negative, we print 0. But the program is written using loop.
To find Fibonacci series using loop, I have simply set 0th terms as 0 and 1st term as 1
and kept adding them to obtain the upcoming fibonacci terms. The counter is basically the
input number which I keep decreasing to obtain 0 and print the result obtained. 
>>> 
Enter debugging mode? no
Enter number: 0
0
>>> 
Enter debugging mode? no
Enter number: 6
8
>>> 
Enter debugging mode? no
Enter number: 2
1
>>> 
Enter debugging mode? 
Enter number: -2
0


Question 3: This program will print the Nth term from Fibonacci sequence as well but
the program is written recursively.
This program does same thing as the loopFibonacci but I used recursion in here. I keep
adding the earlier numbers to get the (n-1) and (n-2)th terms using recursion by storing and
loading these back in their respective registers. And then I simply added those to get the
final solution.
>>>
Enter debugging mode? no
Enter number: 0
0
>>> 
Enter debugging mode? no
Enter number: 10
55
>>> 
Enter debugging mode? no
Enter number: 2
1
>>> 
Enter debugging mode? 
Enter number: -2
0
