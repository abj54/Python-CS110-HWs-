    Bourke-White’s picture of Mahatma Gandhi by his spinning wheel at the peak of Independence Movement in India represents the influence and impact he had in the whole world so that he became the center of attraction, even for those who were against him
    In the picture, there are few things that clearly gains your attraction. Firstly, there is a circular spinning wheel in the picture’s foreground. This spinning wheel, commonly known as “Charkha” is used to weave products like scarves and shawls mostly. The first instance of looking at this circular wheel immediately reminded me of a wheel in an Indian Flag. Though these two wheels are not the same wheels, it might be slightly confusing for any individual to differentiate between these two. The main reason for that would be the vitality or the presentation of these wheels in both this picture and the flag. But there lies another interesting fact that all the formally accepted Indian flags have to weaved from the spinning wheel itself.
    This spinning wheel also represents a revolution from the side of Gandhi. When the British were trying to eradicate the Indian culture by trying to remove Indian products and markets, Gandhi devised a plan to instead boycott British products. This Chakra is used to weave the Indian “dhoti” that he is currently wearing, instead of a pant that he could have worn. By using Indian products, he is trying to strengthen the belief other people. He is trying to help every person gain strength for their nationality and take a pride in their own culture so that the revolution against the East India Company would grow even more and Independence would be achieved sooner. This picture became reason for unity among the people against the one that is trying to hamper the feeling of nationality in them making it iconic.
         Instead of being a slave to any British, the use of this Chakra also created more employment opportunities at that time and a way for their own market to grow bigger. The self-dependency of each individual was a prime need at that time and the employment for their own cultural products and cultural market was deemed better than anything else. Similarly, the gender discrimination back in the society which labelled women as the house-worker was also tackled as male, including Gandhi, used this wheel more often than not.
    Since we are talking about something circular, there is one more circular object that can be seen in the image. The circular glasses that Gandhi has put on. No one can point out a reason for Gandhi choosing a such glasses (except for the fact that they were cheap and easily replaceable). In the picture itself, the glass aids in defining the simplicity of Gandhi. The simple and common lifestyle of Gandhi is reflected by the circular glasses.  Maybe today, these circular glasses carry more importance. For eg. Steve Jobs. The leader of Apple company decided to put on similar circular glasses because he said that the circular glasses defines the simplicity in him. These circular glasses have also been used to represent the heroism in a simple looking man. Clark Kent aka Superman is an example to it. Clark Kent is a simple looking man who changes into a world saving Superman when needed. He puts on similar circular glasses as well. J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter also has circular glasses that he uses rather than more fancy glasses available at the time. Maybe the use of circular glasses is so popular because of the fact that Mahatma Gandhi used to wear those as well. 
    Gandhi in this picture, is doing some studying. During that time, education was definitely not the most common thing in India. There were few schools around and most of these schools were not accessible to all the people. Also people were economically deprived, so naturally to them education was not of most importance but money was. So, they used to indulge themselves in employment opportunities straight away and the main one being agriculture. So education was not the prime importance to them.
    Through the picture, Gandhi is trying to distribute the importance of education. The value of knowledge is tried to be encouraged. He is requesting and encouraging his fellow Indians to not just limit themselves to the traditional method of employment, but also value the necessity of education. He believed that the education and knowledge would result in the creation of better opportunity for themselves. The increase in opportunities would lead them to have a better life as well. This better life, he believed would fuel the Independence campaign and ultimately result in the freedom of his country.
    But how long will the traditional or cultural aspect be saved with the increase in new opportunities created by education? In the picture as well, there is a spinning wheel which is mostly used to weave traditional products while education will certainly lead in the betterment of humane life by creating new and better opportunities. How will these two approaches last together? Or, will they be able to coexist? Gandhi was actually against the English language education system. He opposed the westernized system of education and favored the Hindi language education system. More than modern and western education system, he favored knowledge based education. Increasing the knowledge on all the sectors, he is trying to improve the way things are actually done. Rather than being submissive to the modern education system, he is planning on using that knowledge for the betterment of his traditional and cultural sectors. The education and traditional wheel can exist together, and he is trying to encourage all the people to gain the knowledge and use it for the betterment of their own country.
    The above mentioned aspect of using education for traditional progress can be encouraged by the fact that in the picture he is wearing only a dhoti. It is the man’s traditional cloth in the country. Despite being an educated man (Barrister), he didn’t really favor the British approach and he followed what he preached. Instead of just asking for the abolishment of British products, he actually showed the way to do it. The approach of his people in believing in doing rather than talking is clearly expressed here. 
    Gandhi, with his circular glasses and dhoti, today is a common site. There are several books written on him and there are movies that focuses on his principles as well. The streets are named after him and then then he also lies in the Indian currency. The Chakra in the picture, was actually in the Indian Flag itself for a certain period of time. Gandhi through this pictured raised the awareness among the people and provided them with the opportunities to get up on their own and fight for themselves. The feeling of unity, gender and economic wise, was provided through this picture.
    The other thing in picture that is alerting is the source of light. There is a mini window with bars on it which gives the feeling of being in a prison. Being under British rule, India was forced to be indirect slaves to the British. Most of the houses had that window structure that signified the prison feel among the people. Gandhi has given huge importance to such windows as Gandhi never felt free or independent from British even when they claim equal rights for both British and Indians. These windows act as constant reminder of the situation that India was in at the time, Indians were at that time. Despite having some opportunities or some benefits that Indians were provided, this picture never let them get away from the fact that they still are the prisoners and they still are not free. Fight for independence was not over yet and this picture act as a medium so that revolution would not end without success.
    Gandhi in this picture (as in most of his picture) is represented as a bald, weak, old man with just a dhoti, his circular glasses and a stick. How can such a man be a hero, a revolutionary leader? Gandhi actually defied all the concept of being a hero. The time when the leaders in India were like Bhagat Singh, Azaad etc. who were well built and muscular people, Gandhi led a revolution being an old and weak guy. His revolution was different than that to other, he was against violence. He wanted to attain freedom but not with violence and terror, but with peace and harmony. Similar type of feel is clearly evident from this picture as well. The picture is just calm and serene which gives us the idea about Gandhi’s ideology and beliefs. It also encouraged his fellow people to bring out their calm side rather than just use violence and attack the British people. This would make all of them stronger in a sense that it is not power which wins freedom or independence , war doesn’t lead to peace. The peace in this picture shows the same idea that is employed by Gandhi and what he is asking others to adapt.
    Hence a common concept of calmness that is represented in this picture with a weak and an old man coming up as an ultimate hero makes this picture iconic. Gandhi and his philosophy is represented in some sense in this picture which is somewhat accepted by other Indians or what he is asking them to accept. The wheel, his reading through circular glasses and his clothes all refer to what he has learned from his society or what he wants his society to learn and the impact that these things might have in the future.
